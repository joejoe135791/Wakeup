# Wakeup
Working on a wake up routine to wake myself up. I'll list hardware and software (if I ever finish this lol)

# current list of planned features
- [ ] easily switch when the alarm goes off (possibly through web interface)
- [ ] tts for weather using [Open weather API (you must provide your own api key)](https://openweathermap.org/api) or another alternative
- [ ] google calendar integration (reads your google calendar (provide your own api key))
- [ ] motivational quotes through an api (such as [zenquotes](https://zenquotes.io/))
- [ ] interface with smarthome devices (such as smart lights or smart light switches)

# building
I'll be building this by using a raspberry pi (or similar) and I will document this in the [documentation](Documentation.md)

this will be made using python so keep that in mind
